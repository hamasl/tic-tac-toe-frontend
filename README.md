# tic-tac-toe
Frontend for a tic-tac-toe game that can be played with 3x3 and up to 10x10 squares.  
Made to be played locally on one device.  
Made everything in one component since this was a small project, and creating multiple components would only add to the complexity.  
Made the game with the intention of learning vue, and therefore the styling is not the most important aspect of it.  
To run the game perform the project setup and compile and hot-reloads for development. Then open the your browser at localhost:8080 and enjoy!
